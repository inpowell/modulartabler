Description: Builds tables of counts modularly. Each table is described by
    mapping tables for each dimension. Dimensions can be mixed and matched to
    build different tables with the same margins. Small cells can be suppressed,
    and mapping tables can be used to determine what secondary suppression is
    necessary to prevent back-calculation.
